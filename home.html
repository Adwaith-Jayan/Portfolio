            <h1> Hi there! I'm <span class="name-animate">Adwaith</span></h1>
            <p>
                I'm Adwaith Jayan, a Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in <br/>Full Stack Development
                and Machine Learning. 
                I enjoy building web applications that combine <br/> intuitive design with real functionality,
                and I'm equally fascinated by how data <br/>and intelligent algorithms can drive smart solutions.
                I'm constantly exploring new technologies <br/>to grow as a developer and problem solver.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of tech, I'm an avid gamer and love diving into immersive game worlds that challenge <br/> 
                strategy and creativity. I also enjoy watching web series and movies — it's my way of relaxing <br/>
                 and drawing inspiration from storytelling, visuals, and character design. <br/>
                 These hobbies keep me refreshed and often spark new ideas in my projects.
            </p>
